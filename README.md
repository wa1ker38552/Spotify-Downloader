# Spotify-Downloader

Downloads mp3 off YouTube after searching Spotify for song results. Spotify is used to make sure that the search is actually a song not just a random video from YouTube. Uses Spotify's search API to make this possible. Uses YouTube DL and YouTube Search to search for and download videos from YouTube. I used a module for searching YouTube since I don't wan't to get a Google API key :]
